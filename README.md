# Bharat Intern - One-Month Virtual Intership

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the tasks assigned during my one-month virtual internship with Bharat Intern. This repository contains implementations for three tasks:

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Stock Prediction using LSTM

- **Description**: This task involved utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms to predict stock prices.
- **Files**:
  - [`Stock_Price_Prediction_Using_LSTM.ipynb`](https://github.com/Ashutosh-Singh-Thakur/Bharat-Intern-Internship/blob/main/Stock-Prediction/Stock_Prediction_Using_LSTM.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing the code for stock prediction.

### 2. Titanic Classification

- **Description**: Task focused on creating a classification model for predicting the survival status of Titanic passengers.
- **Files**:
  - [`Titanic_Classification.ipynb`](https://github.com/Ashutosh-Singh-Thakur/Bharat-Intern-Internship/blob/main/Titanic-Classification/Titanic_Classification.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook with the code for the Titanic classification project.

### 3. Number Recognition

- **Description**: Project centered around recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.
- **Files**:
  - [`Handwritten_Digit_Classification.ipynb`](https://github.com/Ashutosh-Singh-Thakur/Bharat-Intern-Internship/blob/main/Number-Recognition/Handwritten_Digit_Classification.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the number recognition task.

## Running the Notebooks with Google Colab

You can run these notebooks on Google Colab by clicking on the Google Colab icon (top left) within each notebook file. This will redirect you to the Google Colab environment, where you can execute the code. Changes made in Google Colab will not reflect in the original files.

## Instructions

Feel free to explore each task by running the notebooks. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me.

Happy coding!
